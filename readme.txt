Add sidebars to WordPress posts and pages using shortcodes with a sidebar Name or ID.

== Description ==

= Features: =

* Add sidebars to WP Posts and Pages with shortcodes using a sidebar Name or sidebar ID.
* Add one or more optional custom classes to match your theme styles or custom CSS styles.

= How to Use: =

**Method 1 - (Recommended Use: Add a sidebar using a sidebar Name.)**

A sidebar Name can be found in the `Appearance > Widgets` section of your WordPress Admin Area.

*Example uses:*

* `[sidebar name="your-sidebar-name"]`
* `[sidebar name="your-sidebar-name" class="custom-class"]`
* `[sidebar name="your-sidebar-name" class="custom-class-1 custom-class-2 custom-class-3"]`

**Method 2 - (Advanced WP Users: Add a sidebar using a sidebar ID.)**

A sidebar ID can be found in your theme's `register_sidebar` functions, usually in the theme's `functions.php` file.

*Example uses:*

* `[sidebar id="your-sidebar-id"]`
* `[sidebar id="your-sidebar-id" class="custom-class"]`
* `[sidebar id="your-sidebar-id" class="custom-class-1 custom-class-2 custom-class-3"]`

**General Notes**

* The spelling and capitalization of a shortcode Name or ID must exactly match that of the desired sidebar.
* Definition of an active sidebar: An active sidebar is a sidebar that contains widgets.
* A `[sidebar]` shortcode without an active sidebar Name or active sidebar ID displays nothing.
* An active sidebar ID overrides a sidebar Name if both are present in the same shortcode.
* There is no limit to the number of shortcodes that can be used on the same page or post.
* The same sidebar shortcode can be used multiple times on the same page or post.

**HTML Class Notes**

* Separate multiple custom classes using a space character. Examples shown in `Method` sections above.
* There is no limit to the number of custom classes that can be used.
* Each custom class must only contain (letter,number,-,_) characters, otherwise all custom classes are omitted.
* The sidebar ID is always added to the HTML class attribute if it contains only (letter,number,-,_) characters.
